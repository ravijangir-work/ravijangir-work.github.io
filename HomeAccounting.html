                <h2>Problem Area</h2>
                <p>Due to the pandemic, most users switched to online payment methods to avoid contact through cash exchange. Online payment via phone apps like GPay, and Paytm made the whole transaction process smooth and convenient.</p>
                               
                <p class="para-space">But it raised a new concern. Due to increased online transactions, people cannot track the cash outflow. During my college days, it was hard for me to track the cash outflow. It hit me when I used to see my bank balance at the end of the month and keep wondering where I spent all my money. My other friends were also facing the same issue.</p>

                <p>After evaluating the app among designers and talking to parents whose kids are using the jellow app, we realized the engagement of this app is pretty low, and it’s hard for them to remember the sentences for a longer time. Kids also have a short attention period, making it difficult for parents to make their kids sit and learn.</p>

                    <h4>Contextual Inquiry</h4>
                    <p>Armed with this vague idea of our product, we moved ahead to conduct a few interviews with people to understand the underlying problems through Contextual Inquiry.</p>
                    <p class="quote spacing-3">We employed the Master/Apprentice approach to understand the system and people's concerns thoroughly, while we could easily gel in with them as partners to understand their points of view.</p>
                    <p class="spacing-4">We conducted 19 interviews. Following is the spectrum of the variability of the people we interviewed:</p>

                    <h4>Interpreting Interviews</h4>
                    <p>After conducting interviews, we interpreted them and classified them as User Statements, Observations, and Breakdowns to derive Insights and Design Ideas.</p>

                    <p>To understand the system better from the eyes of our primary users, we drew up quick work models. We were able to identify a few critical major breakdowns from the same.</p>

                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>Now, we wanted to use the research outcomes to brainstorm many ideas. We put the design implications, personae, and goals on the board and discussed ideas individually. We then had a discussion and came up with more ideas to pursue. This helped us in creating low-fidelity wireframes.</p>

If enabled, which is the default, the app sends a notification to users to check whether they have made the regular payment. For example: whether they have collected the milk today or not. By just pressing "Yes," it would automatically enter the data. The time of push notification will be decided based on past regular payment's time of entering the data. If collected earlier, they can hit the "Confirm" button to record today's collection.</p>
