                <h2>Problem Area</h2>
                <p>In March 2020, Covid-19 hit India, and the cases started rising. After looking at the situation, the Indian Govt decided to impose the lockdown throughout the nation. It affected the market on a vast scale, and GDP also dropped. Farmers are the backbone of our economic growth. Around 60% rural Indian households making their living from agriculture and contributing 19.9% to the GDP of India. So, What about farmers and their markets? Also, it was not safe for the consumers to go out and get vegetables, fruits & cereals on the consumer side.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>We decided to conduct the primary and secondary research. We began with the preliminary research by going through various articles and authentic research papers to get the overview of agriculture chain and how it got affected due to Covid-19. This helped me in formulating the research questions needed to get a deeper context of the current situation.</p>

                <h2>Design Challenges</h2>
                <p>After gathering a lot of data, we analyzed each of them and synthesized them to articulate our insights. These insights would further act as a source of opportunity areas for us.</p>

                            <p>We give our customers the option to choose from multiple farmers because farmers grow on average 2-3 crops in India. </p>

                            <h5>How to provide these goods to consumers?</h5>
                            <p>We took inspiration from the Dabbawala System of Mumbai, India, and tried to replicate it with minor changes to create the network among the suppliers. The dabbawala has an intricate system of multiple stops where the order is divided according to the address. Though they treat their work as religion and would be hard to replicate the same feeling, suppliers from different locations can come to a common place and exchange the goods for a common location.</p>

                            <p>From our analysis, we knew that consumers look for fresh items so that they could use them in their coming lunch or dinner. So, we decided rather than making the delivery 24X7, we can select time in such a fashion that they can get the fresh items before dinner or before lunch as per their choice. </p>

                        <p>There are 2 broader issues: Freshness & Trust. So, we decided to mention the explicit time and date of plugging the vegetables and fruits. This would generally be the time when the farmers put images of their goods on the app. There are chances that farmers might put a good image and sell old items then the consumers have the option to give feedback which would decrease its review and rating.</p>
