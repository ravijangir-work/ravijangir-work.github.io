            <h1>API Performance Summary</h1>
            <p>In the context of API producers publishing their APIs on Postman, there was a need for a system to monitor consumer engagement and improve their APIs for greater adoption by consumers. I led the design of a consumer engagement and feedback system. I collaborated to design a monthly engagement summary emails tailored for API producers. The positive outcome of this effort was reflected in the key performance indicator (KPI) for adoption—the fork count of the producer's APIs increased by 15.2%.</p>

                    <p>At Postman, I primarily served as a Product Designer, but I also took on User Research responsibilities at key stages of this project. My objective was to design a new feature that would help API producers monitor the performance of their APIs and take action to improve them. In this case study, I’ll highlight how my user research efforts played a critical role in shaping the product direction and ultimately contributed to the project’s success.</p>

                    The initial problem statement provided by the PM was vague and open-ended:

                <p class="spacing-3">To uncover the real problem behind this fuzzy statement, I switched into research mode—asking a series of “Why?” and “So what?” questions to get to the root of the issue and develop empathy for the users' pain points.

                <h4 class="primary-content">Preliminary Questions</h4>

                <h4 class="primary-content">1:1 with Key Stakeholders</h4>
                <p class="spacing-3">To answer these questions, I conducted a series of 1:1 interviews with key stakeholders, including Product Managers, Product Head and Design Manager. These conversations helped me differentiate between what we already knew and what we still needed to learn. They also clarified internal expectations and aligned the team around shared research goals before engaging with users.</p>
