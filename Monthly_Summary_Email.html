                        <p> In the context of API producers publishing their APIs on Postman, there was a need for a system to monitor consumer engagement and improve their APIs for greater adoption by consumers. I led the design of a consumer engagement and feedback system. I collaborated to design a monthly engagement summary emails tailored for API producers. The positive outcome of this effort was reflected in the key performance indicator (KPI) for adoption—the fork count of the producer's APIs increased by 5.2%. </p>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIs—faster.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="problem-area" class="project-content">
                <h2>What are we solving for?</h2>
                <p>Every day, millions of people use Postman, creating lots of collections, workspaces, and APIs. But they have trouble seeing how well they're doing. They want to know how their APIs are doing and what users think. Furthermore, as a vital bridge connecting producers and consumers, our aim is also to empower producers to build “quality” APIs for their consumers.</p>

                <h2>Method</h2>
                <p>We chose a movie review writing task and a suggestion system based on GTP-2 fine-tuned on the IMDb movie reviews corpus. We ask participants to watch two movies and then write a review for each, once with suggestions enabled and once without. We encouraged writers to express their personal opinions through their reviews and think aloud as they did so. Following that, We asked writers to rate the movies they watched before writing the review and allotted the suggestion system such that we got a distribution of writers along an ‘alignment spectrum’.</p>
                <p class="spacing-3" >We collected concurrent think-aloud protocols while the users wrote their reviews and retrospective think-aloud protocols after they had finished writing. We qualitatively analyzed these with the screen recordings of the writers’ writing process. We use the Hayes Cognitive Process Model of writing (2012) as a theoretical framework to analyze our qualitative data.</p>
                
                <div class="primary-content">
                    <h4>Movie Selection</h4>
                    <p>We chose 30 movies for our study as an initial set. We chose movies that were not widely released and ‘mainstream’, to ensure that the writers had not watched the movie previously and their reviews were not affected. We also avoided
                    polarising genres such as historical dramas, war, political movies, animated movies, and documentaries. We picked movies from those released between 1990 and 2021.
                    </p>
                    <p class="spacing-3">
                    We rated the chosen movies based on ratings from three established sources: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes (Critic and Audience scores), and Letterboxd. Ratings from all three sources were averaged on a scale of 1 to 10 and utilised for final rankings. Based on this rating, the movies were divided into three categories: Bad (1-3), Neutral (4-7), and Good (7-10).We randomly chose three movies from each category, resulting in the nine movies.

                    <h4>Participants</h4>
                    <p>We recruited participants who were university students or recent graduates, who had at least ten years of education in English and frequently watched English movies. All participants were reasonably fluent desktop typists and identified themselves as non-native English speakers — whose mother tongues were Marathi, Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu, Assamese,and Gujarati. Their K-12 schooling, however, was completed with English as a medium of instruction.

                    <li>  We can't tackle all issues simultaneously. We need to filter and prioritize the most critical problems, gradually increasing our scope.
