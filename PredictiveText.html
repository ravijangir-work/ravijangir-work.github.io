            <h1>Human - GenAI System</h1>
            <p>Research to understand writer’s interaction and decision making processes while engaging with such systems is still emerging. We decided to shed light on writer’s cognitive processes while interacting with suggestions. We performed qualitative research to generate actionable insights. As a result, we came up with design opportunities and model to build better Human-AI suggestive system.</p>

                <p class="spacing-3">We asked participants to write their movie reviews in our presence. Due to COVID-19, the setup included two researchers and one participant, who shared their screen while composing the review. We implemented a concurrent think-aloud protocol, encouraging participants to verbalize their thoughts during the writing process. Following this, we conducted a retrospective think-aloud protocol, where we recorded their writing session and later played it back for them, asking follow-up questions. The entire session was recorded, and we created memos during the process.</p>

                <h2>Method</h2>
                <p>We chose a movie review writing task and a suggestion system based on GTP-2 fine-tuned on the IMDb movie reviews corpus. We ask participants to watch two movies and then write a review for each, once with suggestions enabled and once without. We encouraged writers to express their personal opinions through their reviews and think aloud as they did so. Following that, We asked writers to rate the movies they watched before writing the review and allotted the suggestion system such that we got a distribution of writers along an ‘alignment spectrum’.</p>
                <p class="spacing-3" >We collected concurrent think-aloud protocols while the users wrote their reviews and retrospective think-aloud protocols after they had finished writing. We qualitatively analyzed these with the screen recordings of the writers’ writing process. We use the Hayes Cognitive Process Model of writing (2012) as a theoretical framework to analyze our qualitative data.</p>
                
                <div class="primary-content">
                    <h4>Movie Selection</h4>
                    <p>We chose 30 movies for our study as an initial set. We chose movies that were not widely released and ‘mainstream’, to ensure that the writers had not watched the movie previously and their reviews were not affected. We also avoided
                    polarising genres such as historical dramas, war, political movies, animated movies, and documentaries. We picked movies from those released between 1990 and 2021.
                    </p>
                    <p class="spacing-3">
                    We rated the chosen movies based on ratings from three established sources: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes (Critic and Audience scores), and Letterboxd. Ratings from all three sources were averaged on a scale of 1 to 10 and utilised for final rankings. Based on this rating, the movies were divided into three categories: Bad (1-3), Neutral (4-7), and Good (7-10).We randomly chose three movies from each category, resulting in the nine movies.

                    <h4>Participants</h4>
                    <p>We recruited participants who were university students or recent graduates, who had at least ten years of education in English and frequently watched English movies. All participants were reasonably fluent desktop typists and identified themselves as non-native English speakers — whose mother tongues were Marathi, Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu, Assamese,and Gujarati. Their K-12 schooling, however, was completed with English as a medium of instruction.

                <p>Our interface consists of a text editor capable of providing phrase and word completion suggestions both at the end of and in between text. We built three versions of the text editor, one with suggestions powered by a language model trained on an IMDB review corpus with reviews with an average rating of 2.5, the second with an average rating of 8.5, and the third without suggestions. The suggestion system takes in the last 50 words the user has written to compute the suggestion using the language model running in the back-end. </p>
