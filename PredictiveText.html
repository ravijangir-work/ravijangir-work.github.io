                <h2>Research Area</h2>
                <p>Writing with next-phrase suggestions powered by large language models is becoming more pervasive by the day. However, research to understand writers' interaction and decision-making processes while engaging with such systems is still emerging.</p>
                <p class="para-space">We conducted a qualitative study to shed light on writers' cognitive processes while writing with next-phrase suggestion systems. To do so, we recruited 14 amateur writers to write two movie reviews each, one without suggestions and one with suggestions. Additionally, we also positively and negatively biased the suggestion system to get a diverse range of instances where writers' opinions and the bias in the language model align or misalign to varying degrees.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="overview" class="project-content">
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>We are motivated by the research in writing and the research in suggestion systems that are meant to aid writing. With the advent of transformer-based probabilistic language models [54], text generation has become sophisticated and viable enough to be used in writing interfaces to provide synchronous next-phrase suggestions, as seen in popular products like Google Smart Compose and LightKey. As the writer types, the editor predicts an in-line phrase that the writer can select (Fig.1). While there is rapid progress in natural language processing technologies that enable such interfaces, research in understanding writer interaction with such technologies and their effects is still emerging.</p>

                    <p>Examples of next-phrase suggestions system</p>
                </div>
                
                    <p class="spacing-3">Recent studies have shown that writing and communication are influenced by the presence and content of suggestion systems — in terms of vocabulary use, overall perceived sentiment, and interpersonal perception. There has been recent research on how the writing process is affected by a suggestion system, it has primarily been done through a behavioral lens, hence not revealing the decisions writers make that lead to the observed behavior.</p>
                    <p class="spacing-3">Writing research has long studied the writing process through a cognitive lens. The Hayes Cognitive Process Writing Model (2012), a holistic cognitive model of writing, describes writing as a complex, non-sequential interaction between various cognitive writing processes.</p>
                    <p class="spacing-3">In this study, we used the Hayes model as an analytical lens to qualitatively understand how writers interact with an in-line next-phrase suggestion system, and compared writing with and without suggestions. Additionally, we studied how misalignment between sentiment bias in the model and the writer’s opinion affects writer-suggestion interaction.</p>

            <section id="method" class="project-content">
                <h2>Method</h2>
                <p>We chose a movie review writing task and a suggestion system based on GTP-2 fine-tuned on the IMDb movie reviews corpus. We ask participants to watch two movies and then write a review for each, once with suggestions enabled and once without. We encouraged writers to express their personal opinions through their reviews and think aloud as they did so. Following that, We asked writers to rate the movies they watched before writing the review and allotted the suggestion system such that we got a distribution of writers along an ‘alignment spectrum’.</p>
                <p class="spacing-3" >We collected concurrent think-aloud protocols while the users wrote their reviews and retrospective think-aloud protocols after they had finished writing. We qualitatively analyzed these with the screen recordings of the writers’ writing process. We use the Hayes Cognitive Process Model of writing (2012) as a theoretical framework to analyze our qualitative data.</p>
                
                <div class="primary-content">
                    <h4>Movie Selection</h4>
                    <p>We chose 30 movies for our study as an initial set. We chose movies that were not widely released and ‘mainstream’, to ensure that the writers had not watched the movie previously and their reviews were not affected. We also avoided
                    polarising genres such as historical dramas, war, political movies, animated movies, and documentaries. We picked movies from those released between 1990 and 2021.
                    </p>
                    <p class="spacing-3">
                    We rated the chosen movies based on ratings from three established sources: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes (Critic and Audience scores), and Letterboxd. Ratings from all three sources were averaged on a scale of 1 to 10 and utilised for final rankings. Based on this rating, the movies were divided into three categories: Bad (1-3), Neutral (4-7), and Good (7-10).We randomly chose three movies from each category, resulting in the nine movies.

                <div class="primary-content">
                    <h4>Participants</h4>
                    <p>We recruited participants who were university students or recent graduates, who had at least ten years of education in English and frequently watched English movies. All participants were reasonably fluent desktop typists and identified themselves as non-native English speakers — whose mother tongues were Marathi, Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu, Assamese,and Gujarati. Their K-12 schooling, however, was completed with English as a medium of instruction.

                <h2>Apparatus</h2>
                <p>Our interface consists of a text editor capable of providing phrase and word completion suggestions both at the end of and in between text. We built three versions of the text editor, one with suggestions powered by a language
                    model trained on an IMDB review corpus [ 44] with reviews with an average rating of 2.5, the second with an average rating of 8.5, and the third without suggestions. The suggestion system takes in the last 50 words the user has written to compute the suggestion using the language model running in the back-end. </p>

                <p>
                    We begin our findings by presenting a few examples of suggestions generated during the writing sessions of eight of our participants presented in Table 4 as eight different writer-suggestion alignments leading to uniquely different generations and interactions. We provide the text they had written just previously for context. Next, we report how suggestions contributed to the various writing processes as defined by Hayes(2012)[31 ]. We then describe how writers evaluated the suggestions for incorporating them into their text and what factors governed this evaluation. Finally, we compare the writers’ process with and without suggestions to report some interesting effects we observed

                            Writers often abstracted a topic/theme present in a suggestion and used it as an inspiration for new sentences. When writers did not have a proposal, instead of coming up with one from scratch, they would abstract a topic from the suggestion and use that as a prompt to generate a proposal for their upcoming sentence.

                            U9 was suggested <span class="suggestion">“...but the writing is also pretty good." </span> by the system. They rejected the specific opinion in the suggestion but picked up the theme: ’writing of the film’ and expressed their own opinion about it, <span class="wrong-suggestion"> “the writing of the film was weird”</span>. U9 later remarked: <span class="right-suggestion">“I saw the term writing and [thought might as well write about it]”</span>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This was evident when we compared writers’ with-suggestion reviews with their without-suggestion reviews. We observed increased use of <span class="suggestion">“classic movie-review language.”</span>  (as described by one of the writers - U5; such as <span class="right-suggestion">"a must-see for all ..."</span>  (U5),  <span class="right-suggestion">"... is top-notch."</span> (U7), <span class="right-suggestion">"... I wouldn’t really recommend it"</span> (U9) etc.

                            As expected, misalignments between the writer’s intention and suggestions increased the chances of writers rejecting suggestions. Misalignment became an important criterion for evaluation.

                        <p>
                            For example, U3 loved the movie (rating it 9) but was assigned a system with opposite sentiments (degree of misalignment = 6.5). U3 remarked, <span class="wrong-suggestion">“Suggestions were continuously telling me it was a very bad movie... I was like no, it was not a really bad movie.”</span>

                    <p class="left-space spacing-2">Writers had mental schemas about what content was appropriate to put in a movie review, whether they were writing with- or without-suggestions. Suggestions going against this schema were often rejected.</p>

                        <p>
                            When U3 got a suggestion saying <span class="suggestion">‘For example’</span>, they rejected it, with the following explanation: <span class="wrong-suggestion">“I was like I’ll maybe give an example but I am like no I wouldn’t want that in a movie review which I would read. I don’t want spoilers to that degree so I didn’t write.”</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            U5 was suggested <span class="suggestion">‘this is one of the few movies that I have . . . ’</span>  at the beginning of the review, but they had a different plan. They rejected this suggestion saying <span class="wrong-suggestion">“[I want to write] a two-line plot summary of the movie.
