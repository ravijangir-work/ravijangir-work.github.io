                    <p>At Postman, I primarily worked as a Product Designer but also took on User Research responsibilities at various stages of this project. My goal was to design the MVP for a new assistive authorization and authentication experience, making the process smoother for developers. In this case study, I’ll highlight how my user research contributed to the project’s success.</p>

Recruiting participants and scheduling interviews would have delayed the process. However, identifying pain points was crucial to defining what this MVP should address.</p>
                <p class="spacing-2">To gain firsthand insights, I tested the top 20 APIs on Postman, focusing specifically on the authorization and authentication experience. To further validate my observations, I analyzed qualitative content from Reddit discussions, where developers shared their struggles with API authentication.</p>
                <p class="spacing-2">Additionally, I conducted 1:1 sessions with the Chief Engineering Architect to discuss and refine the identified pain points. Through this triangulation of data, we defined the core problems that needed to be solved in the MVP.</p>

                <p class="spacing-4">Due to budget and time constraints, recruiting end users was not feasible.

                    <li>  When creating the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), it's crucial to keep the feature set minimal while maintaining high quality. This allows us to effectively test the viability of our idea.

                    <li>Figma prototyping fell short because the API authorization process was complex. To truly test our solution, I took the beta version built by developers and conducted user testing within the company.
