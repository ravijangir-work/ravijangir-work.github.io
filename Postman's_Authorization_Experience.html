                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIs—faster.</p>

            <section id="problem-area" class="project-content">
                <h2>What are we solving for?</h2>
                <p>Over 30 million people around the world use Postman Collections to learn about new public APIs and get to their first successful API call more quickly. However, to send a successful request, authentication is one of the first barriers to entry and is frequently one of the biggest.</p>

                <h2>Method</h2>
                <p>We chose a movie review writing task and a suggestion system based on GTP-2 fine-tuned on the IMDb movie reviews corpus. We ask participants to watch two movies and then write a review for each, once with suggestions enabled and once without. We encouraged writers to express their personal opinions through their reviews and think aloud as they did so. Following that, We asked writers to rate the movies they watched before writing the review and allotted the suggestion system such that we got a distribution of writers along an ‘alignment spectrum’.</p>
                <p class="spacing-3" >We collected concurrent think-aloud protocols while the users wrote their reviews and retrospective think-aloud protocols after they had finished writing. We qualitatively analyzed these with the screen recordings of the writers’ writing process. We use the Hayes Cognitive Process Model of writing (2012) as a theoretical framework to analyze our qualitative data.</p>
                
                <div class="primary-content">
                    <h4>Movie Selection</h4>
                    <p>We chose 30 movies for our study as an initial set. We chose movies that were not widely released and ‘mainstream’, to ensure that the writers had not watched the movie previously and their reviews were not affected. We also avoided
                    polarising genres such as historical dramas, war, political movies, animated movies, and documentaries. We picked movies from those released between 1990 and 2021.
                    </p>
                    <p class="spacing-3">
                    We rated the chosen movies based on ratings from three established sources: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes (Critic and Audience scores), and Letterboxd. Ratings from all three sources were averaged on a scale of 1 to 10 and utilised for final rankings. Based on this rating, the movies were divided into three categories: Bad (1-3), Neutral (4-7), and Good (7-10).We randomly chose three movies from each category, resulting in the nine movies.

                    <h4>Participants</h4>
                    <p>We recruited participants who were university students or recent graduates, who had at least ten years of education in English and frequently watched English movies. All participants were reasonably fluent desktop typists and identified themselves as non-native English speakers — whose mother tongues were Marathi, Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu, Assamese,and Gujarati. Their K-12 schooling, however, was completed with English as a medium of instruction.

They want to know how their APIs are doing and what users think. Furthermore, as a vital bridge connecting producers and consumers, our aim is also to empower producers to build “quality” APIs for their consumers. </p> -->

                <p>
                    I started by learning how to send API calls for the Top 20 teams. This hands-on experience helped me understand what our developers go through. I wrote down what I learned and checked what users were saying on various platforms. Then, I went a step further and interviewed Postman developers to understand their challenges better.

                    <li>During this project, I learned a lot and made a significant impact. I realized the value of using hypotheses when making design decisions.
                        </li>

                    <li>  When creating the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), it's crucial to keep the feature set minimal while maintaining high quality. This allows us to effectively test the viability of our idea.
                        </li>

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        User testing was eye-opening as it revealed flaws in our initial hypotheses, guiding us toward iterative improvements in the user experience.
