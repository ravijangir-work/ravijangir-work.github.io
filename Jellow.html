                <p><a href="https://www.jellow.org/" target="_blank" class="info-link">Jellow Basic Communicator</a> is a freely downloadable friendly Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) system that uses icons/images to aid communication in people learning to speak or with difficulty with speech and language. Jellow Basic helps non-verbal children to communicate and gradually learn to speak - especially those with learning disabilities.</p>
                <p class="para-space">This app was designed by Prof. Ravi Pooavaiha for kids of the age group 4-9 years old. Parents and teachers could also use this as a learning tool.</p>

                <h2>Problem Area</h2>
                <p>After evaluating the app among designers and talking to parents whose kids are using the jellow app, we realized the engagement of this app is pretty low, and itâ€™s hard for them to remember the sentences for a longer time. Kids also have a short attention period, making it difficult for parents to make their kids sit and learn.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>From the beginning, we wanted to make a game to make the learning process engaging. Therefore, it was essential to understand the mental learning model of the kids, observe kids and identify those interactions which create a feeling of joy and excitement among them. Also, talk to parents about their kids' problems while using the Jellow app. This would help us to get more context and allows us to lay the foundation for the design of the game.</p>

So, the jellow app would work best if kids click the right images in the proper context with the help of parents. For example: If a kid wants to eat an orange, they could click on the image of an orange, which would translate their feeling into an audio message. It would say, "I want to eat oranges." </p>

With the help of different vegetables, cooked food (Dal, Rajma), and salads, kids can fill the eye of the smiley with a slice of onion.</p>

                        <p class="spacing-2">Kids can select any sentence or write any sentence as input to the game. The letters of those sentences would be arranged on the ground. Now, each letter would act like a block on which the mascot will jump, and after landing on each block, it will spell that letter, and after leaving the last letter of a particular word, it will pronounce the whole word. The task of the game would be to reach the end of the sentence by crossing various hurdles.</p>

For each meal, the game will ask for liked and disliked food. Then food materials will hang on the roof, and the game's mascot has to eat the desired number of favorite food materials using the move left, move right and jump actions. After eating the food every time, the game will give instructions like "Yumm!! I need more apples". The moment they will eat the worst food, the game will get over.</p>

For the sake of this project, we followed the Indian theme. Since the kitchen atmosphere is a background element, subtle colors were used to not deviate the user's attention from the primary objects, which are the mascot and food. Following are the rough sketch and the final illustrations of the kitchen.</p>

                <p>The game starts by asking them to choose one liked and disliked food out of four options. Then two foods will be hanging on the kitchen roof, and the mascot can eat them as per the action taken by the user. Three levels will be divided based on the day's meal: Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</p>

But during any of the stages, the mascot eats any disliked food, and then the game will get over with a dialogue, "Eww!! I don't want to eat eggs". After eating the desired number of liked foods, the game will move to the next level. For example, the game will move from "Breakfast Level" to "Lunch Level."</p>
