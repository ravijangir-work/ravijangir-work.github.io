            <h1>Evaluating Ruby GenAI</h1>
            <p>Led a UX evaluation of Ruby GenAI's beta feature for generating Help Center summaries, preparing it for a broader release. Designed and executed a 5-day diary study with 6 participants, collecting 17 interaction responses, followed by in-depth interviews to clarify findings. Identified 6 key pain points and recommended design improvements focused on transparency, explainability, and personalization. Additionally, uncovered 4 new use cases for Ruby AI integration, directly influencing product strategy for the next two quarters.</p>

                <p>Ruby is the generative AI companion for Rubrik Security Cloud. Rubrik is actively exploring relevant use cases for integrating Ruby into their platform. Recently, they launched a beta feature that integrates Ruby into the in-product help center of Rubrik Security Cloud. When users search for information, Ruby generates AI-powered summaries by pulling content from relevant documents. Depending on the response and the user's needs, they can engage in further conversation with Ruby, similar to how ChatGPT functions.</p>

They want to know how their APIs are doing and what users think. Furthermore, as a vital bridge connecting producers and consumers, our aim is also to empower producers to build “quality” APIs for their consumers. </p> -->

                        <p class="spacing-2">Before initiating the research, I collaborated with the Product Manager to clarify the objectives of this beta feature and to define what specific research objective we aimed to answer and the business objectives we aimed to achieve. Additionally, I consulted with the Engineers who developed the feature to understand the technical aspects of Ruby AI that would be relevant during the research.</p>

I sought input from my manager, mentor, and key stakeholders, including the Product Manager, Designer, and Developers, to ensure alignment. This collaborative approach helped me create a well-rounded guide for both the opening and closing interviews.</p>

                <p>I used Dovetail to transcribe the interviews, which I then coded and analyzed to derive key findings. For the diary studies, I exported the data into Excel, where I conducted an in-depth analysis and developed follow-up questions for each participant's closing interview.</p>

                <h2>Method</h2>
                <p>We chose a movie review writing task and a suggestion system based on GTP-2 fine-tuned on the IMDb movie reviews corpus. We ask participants to watch two movies and then write a review for each, once with suggestions enabled and once without. We encouraged writers to express their personal opinions through their reviews and think aloud as they did so. Following that, We asked writers to rate the movies they watched before writing the review and allotted the suggestion system such that we got a distribution of writers along an ‘alignment spectrum’.</p>
                <p class="spacing-3" >We collected concurrent think-aloud protocols while the users wrote their reviews and retrospective think-aloud protocols after they had finished writing. We qualitatively analyzed these with the screen recordings of the writers’ writing process. We use the Hayes Cognitive Process Model of writing (2012) as a theoretical framework to analyze our qualitative data.</p>
                
                <div class="primary-content">
                    <h4>Movie Selection</h4>
                    <p>We chose 30 movies for our study as an initial set. We chose movies that were not widely released and ‘mainstream’, to ensure that the writers had not watched the movie previously and their reviews were not affected. We also avoided
                    polarising genres such as historical dramas, war, political movies, animated movies, and documentaries. We picked movies from those released between 1990 and 2021.
                    </p>
                    <p class="spacing-3">
                    We rated the chosen movies based on ratings from three established sources: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes (Critic and Audience scores), and Letterboxd. Ratings from all three sources were averaged on a scale of 1 to 10 and utilised for final rankings. Based on this rating, the movies were divided into three categories: Bad (1-3), Neutral (4-7), and Good (7-10).We randomly chose three movies from each category, resulting in the nine movies.

                    <p>We recruited participants who were university students or recent graduates, who had at least ten years of education in English and frequently watched English movies. All participants were reasonably fluent desktop typists and identified themselves as non-native English speakers — whose mother tongues were Marathi, Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu, Assamese,and Gujarati. Their K-12 schooling, however, was completed with English as a medium of instruction.

To improve this process, I would conduct a collaborative workshop with all stakeholders at the outset. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of what is known and what needs to be learned, ensuring that the research plan is even more targeted and efficient.</p>
